# Voker
Voker is a game that I create in my free time. If you know invoker from Dota, you must be familiar with the mechanic of this game :D So in this game, you need to combine 2 element. Each combination gives you different element output that you use to attack an element-based enemy.


This is not the full project source code, because some of the file is too huge to be uploaded and I still don't have time to maintain it to github haha :D but if you want to try the game, you can download the build zip files :D
